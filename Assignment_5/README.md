Assignment 5 on JENA.

This is based on class presentations on 6/22 and 6/24. 

I chose Option #1.

Option 1: Use Foafamatic site to build a .rdf file of you and your friends. Use Protege to build an .owl file of a few more friends, with some of them same as the FOAF friends, but perhaps with variation in first names. Thus it may be Bob Clark and Robert Clark. Use SameAs in Java code to develop equivalency. Reason with both of them, and display results in a screen capture for your friends' group. Submit the project folder (as a zip folder) and zip it again with the screen capture and submit it as a double zipped folder.

I have also included the following to make it easier to understand:
  1. A screenshot of the code that utilizes the 'sameAs' property in the owl schema.
  2. A screenshot of my .owl file showing the names of the people.
  3. A screenshot of my .rdf file showing the names of people.
  
  NOTE: #2 and #3 were included so that the association between names from both files can be made. Therefore, making it easier 
        to understand the screenshot of the code.
